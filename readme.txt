== Description ==

From21 is a custom PHP classic theme built from the framework of the TwentyTwentyOne theme. This project was started in June 2025 by Eric L. Hepperle.

The purpose of this theme is to help me learn architecture best practices for WordPress classic themes. I will examine and analyze the Twenty Twenty One theme and will gain a good understanding on architecture best practices, naming conventions, etc. In the end, I will have created my own theme and I will know why or why not certain choices have been made.

Finally, one major difference between the Twenty Twenty One theme and From21 is that the latter will be a multi-column theme with sidebar options - the former is only a single-column theme.

== Installation ==

1. In your admin panel, go to Appearance -> Themes and click the 'Add' button.
2. Type in From21 in the search form and press the 'Enter' key on your keyboard.
3. Click on the 'Activate' button to use your new theme right away.
4. Go to INSERT ABOUT PAGE for a guide on how to customize this theme.
5. Navigate to Appearance > Customize in your admin panel and customize to your taste.

== Privacy ==
From21 uses LocalStorage to save the setting when Dark Mode support is turned on or off.
LocalStorage is necessary for the setting to work and is only used when a user clicks on the Dark Mode button.
No data is saved in the database or transferred.
